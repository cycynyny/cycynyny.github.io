                </header>
                <p>
                    I am a Ph.D. student in Mechanical Engineering at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University, focusing on heat transfer performance in 
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supercritical_carbon_dioxide">Supercritical Carbon Dioxide (sCO2)</a>.
                    I obtained my Master’s degree in Aerospace Engineering in 2020, concentrated in Heat Transfer in Propulsion System Design at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University. 
                    Before that, I received my Bachelor’s degree in Aerospace Engineering from Civil Aviation University of China. <br /><br />
                    Besides research, I am also the Instructor of Record (IOR) for undergraduate-level Heat Transfer classes.

                    <strong>Fall 2022</strong> <br />
                    ES 403: Heat Transfer <br />
                    A nearly perfect semester. Most students were proactive, ready to learn, and always prepared. Hurricanes shortened the class time by 200 mins, which was a pity.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Spring 2022</strong> <br />
                    ES 403: Heat Transfer <br />
                    COVID faded away. Students were happy to be in class again, and so was I. My jokes worked, and students mentioned that they enjoyed the classroom time, 
                    but quizzes and exams were too hard. Maybe the COVID effect was still here.
                </p>

                    ME 438L: Model-Based Control System Design Lab <br />
                    Due to understaffing, I returned to teach labs. The standard of the classes was the same as before COVID, but most students lacked motivation. 
                    Adding extra lectures related to the latest technology inspired some of them. Excuses related to physical health were more common.

                    Even though I thought I was well-prepared, fully online classes were a great challenge since no instant feedback could be seen from students. 
                    Most of my jokes did not work, and plagiarism was another big problem. Almost nobody wanted to do the work.
                </p>

                    It was my first semester as an instructor, but COVID-19 hit. It turned out that most students would not watch online videos, no matter how well-organized. 
                    The in-person students had a much better understanding and better grades.

            <p>
                My research area of interests include thermal and fluid sciences with expertise of heat transfer. More specifically, my current field is heat transfer characteristics in supercritical carbon dioxide (sCO2). sCO2 is carbon dioxide held above a critical temperature and pressure, which causes it to act like a gas while having the density of a liquid. It’s also nontoxic and nonflammable, having been used in dry cleaning processes as well as to decaffeinate coffee. Its supercritical state makes sCO2 a highly efficient fluid to generate power because small changes in temperature or pressure cause significant shifts in its density. Here are some benefits of sCO2 power cycles: <br /><br />

                1. Power generation is highly efficient: replacing steam or air with sCO2 as a thermal medium increases efficiency by as much as 10%. <br />
                2. Construction cost is much less: sCO2 equipment is only 10% the size of conventional power plant components, a desk-sized sCO2 turbine could power 10,000 homes. <br />
                3. Environmental impact is reduced: 
                sCO2 is a non-toxic working fluid with the ability to be applied to concentrated solar power, natural gas, coal, biomass, geothermal energy, nuclear energy, ship-board propulsion, and waste heat recovery.
